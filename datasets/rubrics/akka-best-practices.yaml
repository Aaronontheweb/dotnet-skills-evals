  - name: pubsub_correctness
    weight: 0.25
    description: >
      Uses DistributedPubSub for cross-node communication, EventStream only for
      local/single-process scenarios. Never uses EventStream when messages need
      to reach actors on other cluster nodes.

  - name: supervision_understanding
    weight: 0.20
    description: >
      Supervision strategies are defined on parent actors and apply to their
      children, not to the actor itself. Uses appropriate directives (Resume for
      transient errors, Restart for corrupt state, Stop for permanent failures).

  - name: error_handling
    weight: 0.20
    description: >
      Uses try-catch for expected/known failures (HTTP timeouts, invalid input).
      Lets unexpected exceptions propagate to supervision for restart.
      Does NOT catch-all with a generic Exception handler that swallows errors.

  - name: props_patterns
    weight: 0.15
    description: >
      Uses Props.Create for simple actors without DI needs. Uses
      resolver.Props<T>() only when the actor needs IServiceProvider or
      IRequiredActor<T>. Does not over-use DependencyResolver.

  - name: modern_patterns
    weight: 0.20
    description: >
      Uses Akka.Hosting patterns for actor registration and configuration.
      Uses ILoggingAdapter (not ILogger<T>) for actor logging.
      Uses CancellationToken tied to actor lifecycle for async operations.
